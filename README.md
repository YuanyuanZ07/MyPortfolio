# Yuanyuan Zhou – Portfolio Website

This repository contains my personal developer portfolio website.

I built this site to present my projects, technical skills, and current work while studying IT Programming at NSCC (Halifax, Canada).  
The goal is to have a simple place where recruiters or collaborators can quickly understand what I have worked on and how I approach problem solving.

## About Me

I am an IT Programming student interested in web development, debugging systems, and building practical tools that solve real-world problems.

Recently I have been focusing on civic technology — software that connects users with services.  
My current main project is a road issue reporting platform where residents can report potholes or street problems and track their status.

## Featured Project

### Halifax Road Issue Reporting Platform

A civic web application prototype that allows users to:
- report road issues (like potholes)
- attach location and photos
- view reports on a map
- track repair status

The design is inspired by real municipal reporting workflows and helpdesk ticket systems.

This project is still under active development.
